#Impatient IMSLP: A Chrome Extension

## About
I decided my first javascript project would be a little chrome extension dealing with a pesky and (imho) extremely annoying problem (especially when you're horribly impatient and just trying to pull up some music to sightread): the 15-second IMSLP waiting time. So many curses on that!

This extension adds a button which gives a link to download the pdf without having to wait!!! Bypass the 15-second waiting time and save (15 * n)/60 (n = the number of times you download something off imslp) minutes of your life! If you're a classical musician (or just some amateur like me), that's a lot of minutes.

## Dedication
I'm not usually one to dedicate apps (lol), but this one's for Nicolo Paganini, whose concertos I was trying (miserably) to sightread on IMSLP motivated this extension!

## Developers
Just good 'ol me, <a href="github.com/smsukardi">Sarah</a> :)
