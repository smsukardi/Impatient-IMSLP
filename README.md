# Impatient IMSLP: A Chrome Extension

## About
I decided my first javascript project would be a little chrome extension dealing with a pesky problem for classical musicians: the 15-second IMSLP waiting time.

This extension adds a button which gives a link to download the pdf without having to wait. Bypass the 15-second waiting time and save (15 * n)/60 (n = the number of times you download something off imslp) minutes of your life! If you're a classical musician (or just some amateur like me), that's a lot of minutes.

## Dedication
I'm not usually one to dedicate apps (lol), but this one's for Nicolo Paganini, whose concertos motivated this extension!

## Developers
Just good 'ol me, <a href="http://github.com/sarahincode">Sarah</a> :)

## Live
Download it from the Chrome App Store <a href = "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/impatient-imslp/jbkelkchcmmkhnhoekdcfbflmabnhpji"> here! </a>
